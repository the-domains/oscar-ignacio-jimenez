ART OF CINEMATOGRAPHY

the desire to create is everywhere and it stems and evolves from all the choices we make. creativity becomes more vibrant however with how much we steer from orthodox views and make the life our own with out a clear end goal. when i deviate from a plan and allow mistakes to take over that is when i see how an unexpected branch helps evolve my own visual style to tell a story.
